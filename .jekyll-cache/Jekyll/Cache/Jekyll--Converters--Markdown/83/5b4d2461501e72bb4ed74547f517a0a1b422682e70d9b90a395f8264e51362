Tomorrow night â€“ Wednesday 18 â€“ we have our annual awards night, in which we recognise excellent contributions to the club and find out who has secretly been a cactus all this time. Come see this historic event at 6 p.m. in 260-040C (Arts 1). Plus there will be comestibles so come get some of that in ya.
