In Semester 2 2021, Varsity will be running a series of special meetings featuring introductory presentations on the three key aspects of public speaking. These workshops will be built into our usual Toastmasters meetings, so you will get the opportunity to hear a seminar, see a great example of the content applied in a speech and then have the option to practice the skills yourself in an impromptu 2 minute Table Topic speech.

Come and join us every Wednesday from 6-8 pm in the East Wing of the Clocktower, Room 119-G19 (snacks provided). 


Session 0 - Demo Meeting – July 19th
Although not a formal seminar, we will have our first meeting of Semester 2 this Wednesday.
Come along if you would like to meet us, hear some great speeches and see what Toastmasters is like.

Session 1 - Stage presence – July 28th
Engaging your audience is critical to making an impression and getting your point across. In this session, we will cover the basics of overcoming anxiety, using your voice clearly and presenting yourself as a competent and confident speaker

Session 2 – Structure and narrative – August 4th
Many people find that they lose their audience, or rely heavily on notes so as not to get lost. This seminar will equip you with the tools to write speeches that take your audience on an exciting journey through the forest of knowledge, while keeping your thoughts concise and on track

Session 3 – Visual aids and impact – August 11th
Everyone has experienced “death by PowerPoint”, where a presenter reads slides in a monotone for what feels like hours. We will cover the three golden rules for using PowerPoint that allow you to create engaging slides that engage your audience and enhance your presenting style.
