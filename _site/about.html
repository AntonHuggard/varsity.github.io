    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class = "FAQ">
        <h3>When and where do you meet?</h3>
        <p>We meet every Wednesday from 6pm to 8pm at the University of Auckland. Meetings are currently held: <span id="about_meeting_location"></span> <br><br>Meetings generally don't happen for a few weeks around Christmas. If there's nothing on posted here or on our facebook page, send us an email to find out what's going on.</p>
        <h3>How much does it cost to join?</h3>
        <p>It's $50 per semester, which is about $4 a meeting. However, this is only due once you are sure you want to join. This fee gets you access to the Toastmasters International program, speech competitions, formal certifications, resources and more. Further information is on the <a href='membership'>Membership</a> section of this website.</p>
        <h3>What's the difference between Biztalk and Varsity?</h3>
        <p>Varsity is Auckland University's original Toastmasters club. We were so popular, Biztalk had to be created to ensure everyone had a chance to speak. Biztalk has its meetings on Monday and they take themselves more seriously (which is a low bar... we keep things chill at Varsity)</p>
        <h3>Why should I join <em>this</em> club?</h3>
        <p>Because we're very competent, but like to keep things upbeat and fun. If you want a formal business meeting look elsewhere, but if you just want to get some good feedback and learn to speak this is the place for you!</p>
        <h3>What does 'Varsity' mean?</h3>
        <p>It refers to <em>university</em>, but sounds better on the CV.</p>
        <h3>I'm not a student. Can I still join?</h3>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <h3>What's Toastmasters?</h3>
        <p>It's a bit like Freemasons. Only for public speaking. And way less mysterious.</p>
		<p>Seriously though: It's an international organization that's 96 years old and designed to help people get better at public speaking. However, it is very well known and looks great on the CV, as it gives you a great reason to show off about how good you are at communication.</p>
