Hello Friends!

This Friday (the 15th), we are laying down our weapons to play some games with our rival club, Biztalk. It's like how those soldiers played games on Chirstmas during the first World War. The university is still being a big nerd and not letting us go back to campus, so everything will be done online.

The zoom meeting link is still TBA, but hold onto your pants. We'll post it on Facebook or something. If you're keen to join, make sure to get in contact somehow.

Oh yeah. This is also the first post to the new website. At this stage, we don't have a domain name and the website is still under construction but I'm working on it.

Wash your hands.
